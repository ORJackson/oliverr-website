          Hi, I'm Oli. I am soon to be an object oriented software engineer. I'm finishing off a masters in computer science at Swansea University, in Wales, and I'm from the UK.

          I am a walking embodiment of cognitivie disonance. I love being outside and am particularly into surfing, skiing, and climbing. 
          But I also really enjoy the cognitive challenges of solving puzzles, which led me to study computer science.

          After leaving school I studied Philosophy, after a few years and one too many hospitality jobs I left the UK to travel, I trekked in Nepal, spent some time in India, and discovered surfing in Indonesia. 
          At that point in my life my number one priority was to fund surf trips, I took a job in steel construction in Western Australia. I was able to work for a few months, and then spend a good few more in Indonesia. 
          This cycle continued for a while. Before moving back to Europe I took a big trip with some friends up to Darwin, having missed a whole lot of cool sites on the way up due to not having a serious car, 
          I sold my Nissan X-trail and bought a Toyota landcruiser for the way back down. All in all it was around an 8,000 km trip, and I learnt a lot about self-reliance.

        Back in Europe, I moved to Amsterdam and my experience working in Australia landed me a contruction job working for Swapfiets. My team was responsible for renovating offices and setting up warehouses to store bicycles in different cities around Europe. 
          I got to know the Netherlands well as well as quite a few cities in Germany and Belgium.
          When I moved back to the UK I started a residential construction company with a friend of mine who is an architect. We wanted to use modern methods of construction and automate as many business processes as possible. 
          We ran Spatial Design and Build together for a bit over a year. 
          It proved to be quite a challenging industry within which to compete and we ended up parting on good terms. My previous partner's abilities as a designer are up there with some of the best in residential design, Spatial is still running and going strong. 
          Another very formative experience.

        My experiences in Amsterdam working for a fast growing and young company with a strong focus on technology, coupled with my business experience and some time spent online learning to code led me to study Computer Science in Wales. 
          The proximity to surfing, climbing, and mountain biking were also quite a significant pull. 
          I am currently looking for a role as a software engineer. The language I am most strong in is Java, though I also have used Python, SQL, TypeScript, HTML, and CSS.
