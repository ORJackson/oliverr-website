          Hi, I&#39;m Oliver. I am an aspiring object-oriented software engineer, and I am soon to graduate from a master&#39;s in Computer Science at Swansea University. 
        </p>

        <p> 
          I really enjoy the challenges involved in writing code, which led me to return to studying. The language I am strongest in is Java, though I am also familiar with Python, SQL, TypeScript, Javascript, and HTML/CSS.
        </p>

        <p>
          My first degree was in Philosophy.
          I loved it as it was essentially a degree in problem-solving, plus you get to debate complex issues and reimagine how the world should work starting from first principles. 
          Between my first and second degrees, I worked several different jobs, travelled, and started a business. 
          Going back to university and transitioning from philosophy to computer science was quite a significant change of pace. 
          It had been several years since I had had to wrap my head around such complex concepts, and many of my peers came from hard science backgrounds.
          
        </p>

        <p>
          Now, I am almost finished at university, and I&#39;ve enjoyed the degree even more than I expected to. 
          Studying objected-oriented programming in Java has been the highlight. 
          I now think the analytical approach encouraged in Philosophy provides a strong foundation to transition from into programming. 
          The practice of breaking down an argument into its constituent parts and exploring how they work together, if at all, is not too dissimilar from the way you can think about fixing bugs in code. 
          I&#39;ve also enjoyed learning about relational and object-oriented database systems working with MySQL, working on group software engineering projects in Java / JavaFX, and studying how to design efficient algorithms in Java. 
          I am currently working on my final project and dissertation, in which I am applying machine learning to Twitter data to carry out sentiment analysis 	&#40;in Python&#41;.
            
        </p>

        <p>I&#39;m originally from the UK, but I&#39;ve lived in several different countries. I&#39;m also quite outdoorsy, I particularly like to surf, ski, and climb.</p>

        <p>
          After graduating from my first stint at university and a few hospitality jobs I left the UK to travel abroad. 
          I trekked in Nepal, spent some time in the mountains in India, and started surfing in Indonesia. 
          For some time, funding surf trips was my top priority. 
          I worked in steel construction building large domes on cattle stations in Western Australia, as well as some work farming. 
          I was able to work for a few months, and then spend a good few more in Indonesia. 
          This cycle continued for a while. 
          Before leaving Australia to return to Europe I took a big trip with some friends from Margaret River up to Darwin in the Northern Territory. 
          Having been mostly confined to tarmacked roads on the way up, I sold my car and bought an old Toyota Landcruiser for the way back down, traveling through the Kimberley and other remote regions of WA. 
          All in all it was around an 8,000km round trip, and I learnt a lot about self-reliance.
          
        </p>

        <p>
          Back in Europe, I moved to Amsterdam and my experience working in Australia landed me a contruction job working for Swapfiets. 
          My team was responsible for renovating offices and setting up warehouses in different cities around Europe. 
          I got to know the Netherlands well, as well as quite a few cities in Germany and Belgium. 
          After a couple of years and another trip to Indonesia I moved back to the UK and I started a residential construction company with a friend. 
          Our ambition was to use modern methods of construction and automate as many business processes as possible. 
          We succeeded in our ambition and ran Spatial Design and Build together for around a year and a half. 
          However, it proved to be quite a challenging industry within which to compete, particularly during the pandemic, and we ended up parting on good terms. 
          Spatial is still going strong. 
        </p>

        <p>
          My experience in Amsterdam working for a young and technology-focussed company, coupled with my business experience and some time spent online learning to code all gave me a taste of the opportunities held in the world of technology. 
          This led me to enrol in the master&#39;s in Computer Science that I&#39;ve been studying here in Wales &#40;the proximity to surfing and climbing was also an added bonus&#41;.
