          Hi, I'm Oliver. I am soon to be an object-oriented software engineer. I'm finishing off a masters in computer science at Swansea University, in Wales, and I'm from the UK.
         
        </p>

        <p>
          I love being outside and am particularly into surfing, skiing, and climbing. 
          But I also really enjoy the challenges of solving puzzles, which led me to study computer science. 
        </p>

        <p>
          My first degree was in Philosophy, after graduating and one too many hospitality jobs I left the UK to travel abroad, I trekked in Nepal, spent some time in India, and started surfing in Indonesia. 
          At that point in my life my number one priority was to fund surf trips, I took a job in steel construction in Western Australia. I was able to work for a few months, and then spend a good few more in Indonesia. 
          This cycle continued for a while. Before moving back to Europe I took a big trip with some friendsfrom Margaret River up to Darwin, having missed a whole lot of cool sites on the way up due to not having a serious enough car, 
          I sold my Nissan X-trail and bought a Toyota landcruiser for the way back down. All in all it was around an 8,000 km trip, and I learnt a lot about self-reliance.

        <p>
        Back in Europe, I moved to Amsterdam and my experience working in Australia landed me a contruction job working for Swapfiets. My team was responsible for renovating offices and setting up warehouses to store bicycles in different cities around Europe. 
          I got to know the Netherlands well, as well as quite a few cities in Germany and Belgium.
          When I moved back to the UK I started a residential construction company with a friend. Our ambition was to use modern methods of construction and automate as many business processes as possible. 
          We succeeded in our ambition and ran Spatial Design and Build together for around a year and a half. 
          However, it proved to be quite a challenging industry within which to compete and we ended up parting on good terms. My partner's abilities as an architect are second to none in the realm of residential design, Spatial is still running and going strong. 
          Another very formative experience.
          
        </p>

        <p>
        My experiences in Amsterdam working for a young, fast growing, and technology focussed company, coupled with my business experience and some time spent online learning to code all gave me a taste for the opportunities held in the world of technology, 
        leading me to enroll in a Master's in Computer Science at Swansea University in Wales. 

        </p>

        <p>
        The proximity to surfing, climbing, and mountain biking was also quite a significant pull. 
        </p>

        I am currently in search of a role as a junior software engineer. The language I am strongest in is Java, though I have also used Python, SQL, TypeScript, Javascript, HTML, and CSS. Contact me on Twitter or LinkedIn.
