          Hi, I&#39;m Oliver. I am an aspiring object-oriented software engineer. I&#39;m finishing off a masters in computer science at Swansea University, and I&#39;m from the UK.
         
        </p>

        <p>
          I really enjoy the challenges involved in writing code, which led me to study computer science. 
          I&#39;m also pretty outdoorsy, I particularly like to surf, ski, and climb. 
          
        </p>

          My first degree was in Philosophy, I loved it as it was essentially a degree in problem-solving, plus you get to debate complex issues and reimagine how the world should be starting from first-principles. 
          After a few hospitality jobs I left the UK to travel abroad, I trekked in Nepal, spent some time in India, and started surfing in Indonesia. 
          Funding surf trips soon became my top priority, I took a job in steel construction in Western Australia building large domes on cattle stations. I was able to work for a few months, and then spend a good few more in Indonesia. 
          This cycle continued for a while. Before moving back to Europe I took a big trip with some friends from Margaret River up to Darwin. Having been mostly confined to tarmacked roads on the way up, 
          I sold my car and bought a Toyota Landcruiser for the way back down, traveling through the Kimberley and other remote locations. All in all it was around an 8,000km round trip, and I learnt a lot about self-reliance.
          
        </p>

        <p>
        Back in Europe, I moved to Amsterdam and my experience working in Australia landed me a contruction job working for Swapfiets. My team was responsible for renovating offices and setting up warehouses to store bicycles in different cities around Europe. 
          I got to know the Netherlands well, as well as quite a few cities in Germany and Belgium.
          After a couple of years and another trip to Indonesia I moved back to the UK and I started a residential construction company with a friend. Our ambition was to use modern methods of construction and automate as many business processes as possible. 
          We succeeded in our ambition and ran Spatial Design and Build together for around a year and a half. 
          However, it proved to be quite a challenging industry within which to compete, particularly during the pandemic, and we ended up parting on good terms. Spatial is still going strong. 
          Another very formative experience.
          
        </p>

        <p>
        My experience in Amsterdam working for a young and technology-focussed company, coupled with my business experience and some time spent online learning to code all gave me a taste for the opportunities held in the world of technology, 
        leading me to enroll in the Master&#39;s in Computer Science that I&#39;ve been studying here in Wales &#40;the proximity to surfing and climbing was also an undeniable pull&#41;. 

        </p>

        <p>
        Now, I am soon to graduate, and I&#39;ve enjoyed the degree even more than I expected to. Studying objected oriented programminging in Java has been the highlight, 
        strangely enough I now think the analytical approach encouraged in Philosophy provides a strong foundation to transition from into programming. 
        The practise of breaking down an argument into its constituent parts and exploring how they work together, if at all, is not too dissimilar from the way you can think about fixing bugs in code.
        I&#39;ve also enjoyed learning about relational and object oriented database systems working with MySQL, working on group software engineering projects in Java / JavaFX, and studying how to design efficient algorithms in Java. 
        I am currently working on my final project and dissertation, in which I am applying machine learning to Twitter data to carry out setiment analysis.

        I am currently in search of a role as a junior software engineer. The language I am strongest in is Java, though I am also familiar with Python, SQL, TypeScript, Javascript, HTML/CSS. Contact me on Twitter or LinkedIn.
